Linux bash script to find all lines or multi-line paragraphs containing a set of strings in filtered files of current folder and its subfolders recursively, in a simple way for most common usage, without need of complex regular expressions.<br><br>

<b>USAGE:</b><br>
<code>fl [-i] [-p=N] [-w] [pathstr|/pathstr]* str [+|-|++|-- str]*</code><br><br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>

The goal of this linux bash script (fl) is to simply and quickly display all the lines or multi-line paragraphs matching the str parameters in all the files being filtered by the pathstr parameters, see below examples.<br>
Special characters (like *, +, |, :, ...) do not need to be escaped, they are searched directly as provided in the str parameters, which makes the usage very simple.<br>
Binary files contents are also searched, so that as many matching lines as possible are displayed at the end and no occurrence is missed.<br><br>

<b>OPTIONS:</b><br>

-i: ignore lower/upper case during the search<br>
-p=N: consider paragraphs of 2N+1 lines during the search (N >= 1) instead of line by line search (2N+1 = N lines before first str matching line + first str matching line + N lines after first str matching line)<br>
-w: first str to find shall be a whole word (word-constituent characters are letters, digits and underscore)<br><br>

<b>EXAMPLES:</b><br>

<code>fl str</code><br>
=> find all lines containing str in all files of current folder and its subfolders<br>
<code>fl .c str</code><br>
=> find all lines containing str in the .c files of current folder and its subfolders<br>
<code>fl .c .h str1 + str2 - str3</code><br>
=> find all lines containing str1 and str2 and not str3 in the .c or .h files of current folder and its subfolders<br>
<code>fl .c .h str1 ++ str2 -- str3</code><br>
=> find all lines containing str1 and then str2 and then not str3 in the .c or .h files of current folder and its subfolders<br>
<code>fl mypathstr str</code><br>
=> find all lines containing str in the files of current folder and its subfolders whose path contains "mypathstr" ("mypathstr" in file or folder names)<br>
<code>fl .c /mypathstr str</code><br>
=> find all lines containing str in the .c files of current folder and its subfolders whose path does not contain "mypathstr" ("mypathstr" not in file and folder names)<br>
<code>fl -i .c str</code><br>
=> find all lines containing str in the .c files of current folder and its subfolders with lower/upper case ignored<br>
<code>fl -p=1 .c str1 + str2</code><br>
=> find all 3 lines long paragraphs containing str1 and str2 in the .c files of current folder and its subfolders<br>
<code>fl -p=1 .c str1 ++ str2 -- str3</code><br>
=> find all 3 lines long paragraphs containing str1 and then str2 and then not str3 in the .c files of current folder and its subfolders<br>
<code>fl -w .c str</code><br>
=> find all lines containing the whole word "str" in the .c files of current folder and its subfolders<br><br>

Of course, all operators +/-/++/-- and all options -i/-p=N/-w can be used jointly.<br><br>

Examples of searches with special characters:<br>
- Special characters can be searched directly, for example <code>fl "(a*b+[(x/y)-z] || d == e & f)"</code> will search exactly this string without need to escape the special characters.<br>
- For linux shell's special characters \ and $, they shall be escaped with \\ and \$ respectively, for example <code>fl "\\xxx\$"</code> will search all lines containing "\xxx$" in all files.<br>
- Special characters can also be searched directly with their ASCII code, for example <code>fl $'\x09'</code> will search all lines containing tab characters (\t) in all files.<br><br>

Practical examples:<br>
- search of several strings (line by line):<br>
<img src="example_1.png" style="width:64em;height: auto"><br>
- search of several strings inside paragraphs:<br>
<img src="example_2.png" style="width:64em;height: auto"><br><br>
